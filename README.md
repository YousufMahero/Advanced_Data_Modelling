# Coursework in the Advanced Data Modelling at the University of Edinburgh
As an Amazon e-commerce business analyst, using Google Play Store reviews in the UK, customer feedbacks are analysed, and significant quality issues are presented by using natural language processing tools. Additionally, results are compared with other top competitors running in the same online shopping industry namely eBay, and Argos (Redbytes, 2021). Thus, major problems that customer encounter when using our shop or the features that customers are really like to use are enlightened. Finally, results interpreted to give a managerial insight. Considering the most frequent patterns interpreted by Sentiment Analysis, Topic Search method, and text classification models that customer use in their comment for complaining or praising, these patterns will be our focus in the near future.

# Coursework in the Advanced Data Modelling
As an Amazon e-commerce business analyst, using Google Play Store reviews in the UK, customer feedback is analysed, and significant quality issues are presented using natural language processing tools. Additionally, results are compared with other top competitors running in the same online shopping industry namely eBay, and Argos (Redbytes, 2021). Thus, major problems that customers encounter when using our shop or the features that customers are really like to use are enlightened. Finally, results are interpreted to give managerial insight. Considering the most frequent patterns analysed by Sentiment Analysis, Topic Search method, and text classification models that customers use in their comments for complaining or praising, these patterns will be our focus in the near future.
